// Taking the picture of a room that the lobby's card shows.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BO. The user's complaint about the old
// lobby was that it gave no way to see what a design review looked like from outside it,
// and a card with a name and three numbers on it does not answer that. This is where the
// answer comes from: a JPEG of the room's own canvas, written onto the review's row, read
// back by every lobby that lists it.
//
// WHY IT LIVES INSIDE THE CANVAS. Reading a WebGL drawing buffer needs the renderer, the
// scene and the camera, and only React-three-fiber holds those. So this is a component
// that renders nothing, mounted by World, and it reaches the room's state through the
// same store every other scene component uses.
//
// WHEN IT CAPTURES, AND WHEN IT DOES NOT
//
//   * The moment THIS browser's meeting ends. store.endMeeting(true) bumps
//     `snapshotRequest` and nothing else does — one meeting is recorded once, by the
//     browser whose person pressed End, and its picture belongs with that record.
//   * ~3 s after a model arrives or moves, debounced. An import and a gizmo drag both
//     replace the store's scene, so watching it covers "a model was imported", "a model
//     was placed" and "its placement was saved" with one dependency. The debounce is
//     what stops a drag from writing a row per frame.
//   * Only for somebody who may EDIT the review. `can('editReview')` is the room's own
//     answer (lib/reviews/roles.ts): a participant's browser and a guest's do not write,
//     so a review's picture is always one its editors were looking at.
//   * Never when there is nothing on screen. An empty room's snapshot would replace a
//     good picture with a grey rectangle, and the lobby would show it to everybody.
//
// NOTHING HERE MAY BLOCK ANYTHING. Every path is fire-and-forget and every failure is
// logged and dropped: a review without a thumbnail is a card with a placeholder on it,
// which is what it was before this batch, and a meeting that could not be ended because
// a picture failed is a bug in the thing that was supposed to be a nicety.
//
// The renderer's drawing buffer is NOT preserved between frames unless the canvas asked
// for `preserveDrawingBuffer`, so lib/reviews/thumbnail.ts renders a frame and reads it
// in the same synchronous call. That is also why nothing here awaits between the two.
//
// THE CAMERA IS NOT THE ROOM'S. Batch BP: framing the card with the camera whoever
// pressed End happened to be looking through is what produced a model the size of a
// speck in a wide grey floor, because that camera is at [8, 6, 8] at best and anywhere
// at all in practice. lib/reviews/thumbnail.ts poses a temporary camera of its own on
// the bounding box of the review's models, with the same fit rule the lobby's "Turn in
// 3D" viewer uses. Nothing here reads the room's camera and nothing restores one.
