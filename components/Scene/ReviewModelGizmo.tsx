// The room's transform gizmo: Move / Rotate / Scale, applied to the SELECTED
// scene model — or, since batch BR, to one PART of it.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. The amber strip owns the three
// buttons and writes `reviewGizmoMode`; this is the thing those buttons actually
// turn on, and it lives inside the canvas because drei's TransformControls has to
// be an R3F child of the scene it manipulates. The old curate page had the same
// arrangement (components/Scene/ReviewSetupCanvas.tsx) against a single loaded
// model; this one works against the room's scene, where there can be eight.
//
// What it writes depends on the strip's other switch, `reviewGizmoTarget`:
//
//   Whole model — the model's OWN transform, SceneModel.offset/.rotation/.scale,
//     sent as one `setTransform`. Unchanged since batch BH.
//   Part — one node's transform, in that node's own local space, sent as one
//     `setPartTransform` keyed by the node id the Model Tree shows. The node is the
//     one the laser or the tree has SELECTED; there is no second selection.
//
// Both go to the room server as one operation, so it applies the change to its single
// copy and relays the result to everybody. That is the difference between "I moved
// the model" and "the model moved": a drag here is a change to the meeting, not to
// this browser.
//
// Batch BI added a second copy of the answer, written when the drag ENDS: the
// review keeps every model's placement — and, since BR, every moved part — because
// the room server's storage is the room's and a review is opened again long after
// that room is gone. See lib/scene/keepPlacements.ts.
