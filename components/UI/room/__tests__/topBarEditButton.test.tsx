// The top bar's Edit button: who gets one, and what pressing it does.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. Two things are pinned here.
//
// The first is that the button is HIDDEN, never disabled, for somebody who may
// not edit this review: a control greyed out for a person who will never have it
// is a question the room then has to answer, and the room server would refuse the
// press anyway. That is also why `canEditReview` without an `onEditReview` shows
// nothing — the JSX asks for both, so a bar that was told "yes" but has nobody to
// ask cannot offer a button that does nothing.
//
// The second is that adding it displaced nothing: the highlight granularity, the
// pointer menu, People, Share, Privacy and Boardroom are the meeting's controls,
// and a person who is not editing must find them exactly where they were.
