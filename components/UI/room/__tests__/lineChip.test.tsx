// The chip in a variant's own top bar — components/UI/room/LineChip.tsx.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BL. A variant meets in a DIFFERENT room
// from the review's main line (`<reviewId>~<letter>`, its own presence, audio and
// scene), and the address that gets you there differs from the main line's by one
// query parameter. Nothing else in the room looks different — that is the point of a
// variant — so without a say-so on screen a meeting can spend an hour on a steel hinge
// pin and never notice it is not on the main line. That failure is silent, which is
// what makes it worth a test of its own.
//
// Pinned: the chip names the line in the words the app uses everywhere else, its link
// goes to the main line's address (which carries no `?line=`, so every link already in
// circulation still works), it carries the two variant decisions for somebody who may
// make them, and it renders NOTHING at all where there is no line — an ad-hoc session, or
// an install with no database. On the MAIN line it is a small "Lines" menu rather than a
// chip, which is batch BV: same list, no claim about where you are that you had not
// wondered about. The list itself is pinned in lineChipLines.test.tsx.
