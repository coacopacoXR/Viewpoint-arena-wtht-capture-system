// The way out of a room.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BN. Until this batch the only way out of
// a meeting was the browser's back button or the address bar, and the room's logo —
// which every other screen in this app treats as home — went nowhere. What is pinned
// here is that the control is THERE, that it says where it goes, and that it goes to
// the lobby rather than one step back in history: a person who was sent a room link
// has no history to go back to, and a person who came from the tracker would land back
// in the tracker.
//
// It is also pinned that leaving this way does NOT end the meeting: nothing here calls
// `endMeeting` or broadcasts MEETING_END. The room's unmount path is what tears the
// meeting down for this browser — lib/usePartyPresence closes the socket, which is how
// the room server drops a closed tab's presence and hands the host to the next arrival,
// and lib/useWebRTC stops the microphone and camera and closes every peer connection.
