//
// Highlight granularity stays visible — it is used constantly — while the two
// set-and-forget pointer toggles fold into Pointer ▾. To the right of the
// divider are the room controls that used to be a row in the top-right corner.
//
// The bar has to FIT, and what it has to fit is not the window: since batch BQ2 it
// is laid out between the room's left block (logo, lobby, the review's name) and the
// side panel, so the width it gets depends on the panel being open and on the review
// being named. A window media query cannot know either, and the one this bar used
// (`min-width: 1500px`) was wrong in both directions — labels at 1600px with the
// panel open ran under it, and no labels at 1280px with the panel closed threw away
// space that was there. So the bar MEASURES the box it was given and sheds labels,
// least-used first, until it fits; see TOP_BAR_DROP_ORDER.

 * its own children (all `shrink-0`) overflow it, which is exactly what `scrollWidth`
 * reports and what `clientWidth` does not. Watching the box for a change in WIDTH resets
 * to level 0 and lets the climb start again — the panel opening, a window resize, a
