// The continuity line a card carries: "Raised on Rev A · still open on Rev C".
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BC. The sentence itself is decided
// in lib/trackerContinuity.ts, which is pure; this is only the part that gets the
// data to the place the card is drawn.
//
// It is a context rather than a prop because a card is drawn from four places —
// the board's sortable card, the drag overlay that follows the pointer, the list
// row and the drawer — and threading a revision history and a table of close
// timestamps down through the dnd-kit column machinery would mean changing the
// signature of six components that have no other use for either. The provider
// renders no element of its own, so the board's flex layout is untouched.
//
// A card with nothing to say renders nothing at all: no empty paragraph, no
// placeholder row. That is what keeps an install whose database predates
// model_revisions — where no card has a revision — looking exactly as it did.

/**
 * "Main line · S3" / "Variant A · A2" — where this card came from.
 *
 * Sits beside the revision continuity rather than replacing it, because the two
 * answer different questions and a reviewer needs both: the line says which run of
 * meetings this belongs to, the revision says which version of the product it was
 * raised on. A card with no line, or a line whose row was never read, renders
 * nothing — never "Main line · S0".
 *
 * The line is the card's own, falling back to its meeting's: a card added by hand
 * through the tracker's own modal names a session and has never written a line_id.
 *
 * TWO EXCEPTIONS, both from batch BL, and both because a card that has been through
 * a variant can no longer be described by the line it is on:
 *
 *   Adopted. Its `line_id` is the main line now but its meeting's `seq` is a number
 *   on the VARIANT, so "Main line · S2" would name a meeting that has nothing to do
 *   with this card. What it says instead is where it was raised and when the review
 *   took it in: "Raised in Variant A · adopted 12 Oct".
 *
 *   Dropped with its variant. It was closed by the drop rather than by a decision
 *   about the engineering, and the reason is the thing worth reading:
 *   "Closed — dropped with Variant B: Too expensive to tool".
