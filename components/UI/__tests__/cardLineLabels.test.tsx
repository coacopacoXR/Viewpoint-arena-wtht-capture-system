// What a card says about the line it came from once a variant has been through it —
// components/UI/CardContinuity.tsx's CardLineLabel.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BL. Batch BK's label ("Main line · S3",
// "Variant A · A2") is the card's line and its meeting's number, and it stays right for
// every card a variant never touched. Two kinds of card can no longer be described that
// way, and both are pinned here:
//
//   ADOPTED. Its line_id is the main line now, but its meeting's `seq` is a number on
//   the VARIANT — so "Main line · S2" would name a meeting that has nothing to do with
//   this card, and a reviewer who went looking for it would find a different one. What
//   it says instead is where it was raised and when the review took it in.
//
//   DROPPED WITH ITS VARIANT. It was closed by the drop rather than by a decision about
//   the engineering, and the reason the meeting gave is the thing worth reading.
//
// The labels themselves are decided in lib/reviews/lines.ts and pinned there; what is
// pinned here is which one the card reaches for, and that a card no variant ever touched
// still renders exactly what it rendered before.
