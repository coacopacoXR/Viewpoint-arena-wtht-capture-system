// What the lobby's live viewer is allowed to be: a reader, not a second room.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BO. The component under test is the
// target of a React.lazy in the preview panel, so it is the one place in the lobby
// that may pull in three.js — and the reason it can is that it renders the review's
// models with the ROOM's loaders and the room's placement maths. Almost everything
// here is an assertion about reuse rather than about pixels:
//
//   * the models it draws come from the review's stored history narrowed to its
//     main line, exactly as showReviewScene computes them, and a revision that
//     history has hidden is never downloaded
//   * the bytes go through lib/modelsClient.fetchModelFile and the parse through
//     lib/scene/sceneEntries.parseSceneModelFile — a second loader in the lobby
//     would be a second way for the preview to disagree with the room
//   * the review's stored placements reach the model through the room's own
//     applyStoredPlacements, so what somebody moved in a meeting stands where they
//     left it here too
//   * nothing IT does reaches store.ts, because the lobby has no room to put a
//     scene in and a session spent scrolling it must not leave any behind — with the
//     one exception of the room's own components for the three bundled samples, which
//     register their points of interest and their scene trees exactly as they do in a
//     room and never a scene (see ReviewModelViewer's SAMPLE_COMPONENTS)
//   * what it parses, it frees
//
// There is no WebGL in jsdom, so @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei are
// stubbed the way components/UI/Boardroom/__tests__/hideAgents.test.tsx stubs them:
// the canvas becomes a div that renders its children, which is enough to prove what
// the viewer decided to draw and when. three itself is REAL — the parsed groups are
// real Groups holding real geometry, because the component centres them with the
// room's own placeImportedGroup and measures them with Box3.setFromObject, and a
// `{ traverse(cb) }` shape would let both of those go untested.
