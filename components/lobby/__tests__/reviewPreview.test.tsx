// The preview panel: seeing inside a design review without entering it.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BO. Three things are pinned here.
//
// 1. WHAT IT SHOWS — every meeting with its label, its date, who was in it and how many
//    cards it raised, and the minutes of the last one drawn the way the room's own
//    session panel draws them.
// 2. WHO IS OFFERED THE DELETES — the owner and this install's administrators, per
//    lib/reviews/roles.ts `deleteReview`, and NOT the review's editors. Both ask INLINE:
//    window.confirm cannot be styled to the panel that offered it, cannot be tested, and
//    freezes the page behind it while it waits.
// 3. THAT THE 3D VIEWER IS LAZY — three.js is hundreds of kilobytes and the lobby is a
//    list. The chunk is fetched when the "Turn in 3D" button is pressed and not before,
//    which is the whole reason the snapshot exists as the default answer.
//
// The panel's own read (lib/reviews/useSessionMap) is mocked: this file is about what the
// panel DRAWS, and the hook has its own coverage.
