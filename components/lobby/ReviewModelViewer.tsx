// A live, read-only look at the model a design review would open on.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BO. The lobby's preview panel has
// always shown a snapshot: a picture taken the last time somebody was in the room,
// which is no picture at all for a review that has never had one, and a stale one
// for a review whose model was replaced afterwards. "Turn in 3D" swaps that
// picture for this — the same models, standing where they were left, that a room
// opened on this review's own address would start from. The point of the batch is
// that somebody browsing the lobby can see what a design review looks like inside
// without going into it.
//
// The reference implementation is `showReviewScene` in lib/scene/showCurationModel.ts,
// and the scene this viewer builds is deliberately the same answer. THREE things
// differ, and all three follow from being outside a room:
//
//   1. It never touches store.ts. showReviewScene's whole job is to write the
//      shared scene so the room renders it; a lobby that has been scrolled past
//      twelve reviews must not leave twelve scenes behind in the room's global
//      state, and it has no room to leave them in. So the scene is computed into
//      this component's own state and thrown away, and nothing in THIS file reads or
//      writes a store. The one exception is a review whose model is one of the app's
//      three bundled samples, which is drawn by the room's own component for it — see
//      SAMPLE_COMPONENTS below for what those write and why it is safe.
//   2. It draws what the SCENE says is visible — `model.visible === true` — which
//      is store.ts's `sceneModelVisible` with no local overrides. Hiding a model so
//      you can see the one behind it is one participant's business and lives in the
//      room's store, which point 1 has just promised not to read.
//   3. It disposes what it parses. The room's `pruneSceneEntries` drops the
//      reference and stops, which is fine for a canvas that lives as long as the
//      page; this one mounts once per review and a lobby can be scrolled through
//      dozens in a session.
//
// The LOADERS are the room's, not a second set: lib/modelsClient.fetchModelFile
// (the same /api/models download, and the same in-memory cache, so a review the
// lobby has already looked at costs nothing the second time), lib/scene/
// sceneEntries.parseSceneModelFile (the same parse, with the same hash-derived tree
// prefix), and `placeImportedGroup` out of components/Scene/ImportedModel.tsx (the
// room's own centring and scaling). A viewer that parsed the bytes itself would
// agree with the room today and drift from it the first time utils/modelLoader.ts
// changed — and "the lobby shows what the room shows" is the entire claim.
//
// THIS FILE IS A React.lazy TARGET and nothing may import it any other way. It
// pulls in three.js, @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei, and the lobby's
// first paint must not pay for them.

// ─── Which models, and where ────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The scene this review would open a room on.
 *
 * showReviewScene's arithmetic, transplanted: the review's whole stored history,
 * narrowed to the revisions its MAIN LINE was last looking at, plus the curation's
 * own model when history has never recorded it (every review created before the
 * model_revisions table existed), with the review's stored placements applied over
 * the beside-each-other default the history computes.
 *
 * The line id is null and always will be here: the lobby has no line to be on, and
 * a room opened on the review's own address starts from the main line, which is
 * exactly what `originRevisionIds(reviewId, null)` answers.
 *
 * With no stored history at all this reduces to the one-model scene
 * `curationScene` builds — sceneFromRevisions([], unrecorded) keeps the unrecorded
 * model as its line's Rev A — so there is no second code path for a review that has
 * never had a meeting.
 *
 * ONE PLACE THIS IS NOT showReviewScene, and it is on purpose. showReviewScene is
 * only ever called for an asset whose `modelType` is 'imported' — see syncMainModel
 * in lib/activeReviewStore.ts, which returns early for 'none' and for a preset — so
 * it never has to ask what the other model types mean. This viewer does, and the
 * answer it must not give is "nothing": since batch BI every review the lobby
 * creates carries modelType 'none', including one whose meeting imported four
 * models and recorded all four. Gating on modelType the way the room's caller does
 * would have shown an empty panel for exactly the reviews worth looking into. So
 * the gate here is whether the review has any imported model to draw at all, from
 * its history or from its asset, and `modelType` is not read as a gate.
 *
 * IT IS READ AS A SAMPLE, though, and that is the second half of the room's rule. A
 * room opens a review by handing the asset to showCurationModel, which answers false
 * for anything but 'imported'; lib/activeReviewStore's syncMainModel then calls
 * setActiveModelType(asset.modelType), and the store turns that into `scene.builtIn`,
 * which is what World.tsx draws one of its three presets from. So for a review whose
 * model IS a sample, `modelType` is the whole of the answer and the scene record has
 * nothing to say — sceneFromRevisions always answers `builtIn: null`, because a
 * sample has no revisions and no row in model_revisions. Hence `sampleOf` below,
 * reading the same field the room reads, and `scene.builtIn` kept as the first answer
 * so a history that ever did record a sample is honoured too.
