// What the room says while a review is being edited, to the people who are not
// editing it.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. Three things, one stack, because
// they are three answers to the same question and only one of them is true at a
// time for any given person:
//
//   the banner   somebody else has Edit on. Persistent, and the reason the tools
//                are not on this screen — without it a participant would see the
//                review change and have no idea who was changing it.
//   the prompt   I pressed Edit and the room said somebody has it. Dismissible,
//                and carrying the one thing that can be done about it: take over.
//   the notice   I WAS editing and somebody took over. Shown once.
//
// All three read state the room server wrote. None of them guesses, which is what
// keeps "only one person edits at a time" from being six clients' opinions about
// it.
