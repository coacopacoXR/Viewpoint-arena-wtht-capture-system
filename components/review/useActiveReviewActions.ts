// The room's side of the curation tabs' contract.
//
// components/review/draftActions.ts says what a tab may do to a review; this is
// what doing it MEANS inside a room. Two steps rather than the one the curate page
// took, and the second is the whole reason the tabs are store-agnostic:
//
//   1. write to lib/activeReviewStore, which is the copy of the review this room
//      is presenting — the same copy a REVIEW_CONFIG from the room server updates,
//      so an editor and a listener are looking at one thing;
//   2. broadcast the draft that came back, so everybody else's copy becomes it.
//
// Step 2 is not optional and not debounced. The room server relays a REVIEW_CONFIG
// to every other connection and remembers it for whoever joins next; without the
// broadcast an edit would be visible on one screen and nowhere else, which is
// exactly the failure the old curate page could not have — it had nobody to tell.
//
// Persistence is not here either, but it happens because of what is here: a store
// action marks the review as edited by THIS browser (lib/reviewLocalEdit), and
// RoomPage's subscriber saves a second after the last mark — and only on a mark.
// Batch BH widened who that subscriber listens to (the meeting host, or whoever
// has Edit on) rather than adding a second writer that could race it; batch BH3
// made the mark the thing that decides, because a subscriber that saved on any
// change to the review also saved changes that had arrived from somebody else.
