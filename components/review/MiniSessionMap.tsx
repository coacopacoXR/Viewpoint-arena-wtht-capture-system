// The session map, small enough for a lobby card.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BO, from the approved lobby sketch:
// every card for a design review carries a miniature of that review's history,
// because the shape is the part worth knowing before opening it — how far the main
// line has got, whether anything has left it, and whether what left was taken in or
// dropped. So this draws the same picture SessionMap draws: the main line as a dark
// line of stops, a variant leaving it, an adopted variant coming back to a green
// stop, a dropped one going grey and dashed, and the meeting the main line is at now
// filled in. No labels, no counts, nothing to press.
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND LAYOUT. layoutSessionMap places every stop and every line,
// exactly as it does for the full map, and this file only decides how thickly to draw
// what it is handed. A miniature that worked out its own positions would eventually
// disagree with the map it is a miniature of, and a card showing a different shape
// from the review it opens is worse than a card showing none.
//
// Everything here is measured in scaled units rather than in the numbers SessionMap
// uses, because `preserveAspectRatio="meet"` shrinks the whole viewBox into 34px of
// height: a stroke written as 2 units arrives a sixth of that wide, which is a line
// nobody can see. See `unitOf`.
//
// THE WORDS ARE THE SPEC, as they are in SessionMap.tsx: "Main line", "Variant A",
// "session", "adopted", "dropped". Branch, fork, merge and commit do not appear here
// — not in the aria-label, not in a tooltip, not in a comment a reader could be shown.
