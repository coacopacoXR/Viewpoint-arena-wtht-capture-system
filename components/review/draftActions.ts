// The contract between a curation tab and wherever it is being rendered.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH moved the curation tabs out of
// pages/ReviewSetupPage and into the room's own side panel, with Edit on. The
// tabs are ONE copy — the brief was explicit that the room and the old page must
// not each grow their own — so they cannot reach into a store: the setup page
// kept its draft in lib/reviewSetupStore and the room keeps the live review in
// lib/activeReviewStore, and a component that imported either would only ever
// work in one of the two places.
//
// So a tab takes its data as props and its writes as `actions`. Each caller
// builds the actions object from its own store, which is also where the room's
// extra step lives: every write there has to be broadcast, because five other
// people are looking at the same review. The tab does not know or care.
