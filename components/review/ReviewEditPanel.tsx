// The room's Edit panel: the curation tabs, in the side panel where Capture ·
// Comments · Chat usually is.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. This is what "prepare the review
// inside its room" looks like once the separate curate page is gone — the same
// tabs, the same components, rendering against the review the room is holding
// rather than against a draft only this browser had.
//
// Two deliberate choices:
//
//   • DARK, unlike the panel it replaces. The tabs were written for the curate
//     page's #111 sidebar and are one copy, not two re-themed ones; giving the
//     Edit panel the same surface is cheaper than a theme prop on six components,
//     and it makes "the meeting is paused, you are editing" obvious at a glance
//     from anywhere in the room. The amber strip above says the same thing in
//     words.
//   • The tab order is Agenda · Views · Pins · Requirements · Labels · People,
//     which is the order the user approved in the sketch and NOT the curate page's
//     (Asset first). The Asset tab has no equivalent here: its model picker is the
//     model tree's job, its transform is the amber strip's, and its "+ Revision"
//     is BB's import flow.
//
// There is no Asset tab and no People tab on a deployment without accounts.
