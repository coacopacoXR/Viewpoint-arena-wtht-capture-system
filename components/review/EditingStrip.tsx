// The amber strip: what the top bar becomes while somebody has Edit on.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. It replaces the room's top bar
// rather than sitting beside it, and that is the point of the colour as much as of
// the swap: while Edit is on the room is not being run, it is being prepared. The
// pointer, share, privacy and boardroom controls are all things that would change
// the meeting for five other people, and none of them is what this person is here
// to do.
//
// Three tools, one switch and one exit:
//   Undo / Redo — batch BT, and the first thing on the strip because it is the first
//     thing somebody reaches for after a mistake. Ctrl+Z does the same job from
//     anywhere in the room (lib/scene/useSceneEditHistory.ts owns the key bindings);
//     these are icon-only at every width, so they cost no words and are not part of
//     the shedding order below.
//   Whole model | Part — WHAT the tools are attached to, batch BR. The three tools
//     did not change and are not doubled up: Move is Move either way, and a person
//     who has found the tool they want should not have to find it again to use it on
//     something smaller than a whole product.
//   Move / Rotate / Scale — drei's TransformControls modes, applied to whatever that
//     switch says. The gizmo itself is components/Scene/ReviewModelGizmo, inside the
//     canvas; this is only the switch.
//   Reset part / Reset all parts — the way back to the FILE, which undo is not: undo
//     puts a part where the last drag left it, and these put it where the exporter had
//     it before anybody in this meeting touched it.
//   Save this view — the camera where it is, as a viewpoint of the review.
//   Done — gives the edit lock up. The room hears about it and capture resumes.
//
// Only the person editing ever sees this. Everybody else in the room sees
// "Paco is editing the review" instead — see ReviewEditingBanner.
//
// The strip has to FIT, and what it has to fit is not the window. It is handed the same
// box the top bar it replaces is handed — everything between the room's left block and the
// side panel — and since batch BS it MEASURES that box and sheds words, least-important
// first, until it fits: the mechanism batch BQ2 gave the top bar, in lib/useCompactLevel.
// Before that it asked the WINDOW with four different `min-width` rules, which is how it
// came to run past its container at 1600x900 with the side panel open: Reset part, Reset
// all parts and Save this view landed on top of the review's name, and Done — the only way
// out of Edit — was pushed off screen. A window cannot know how wide the block beside the
// strip has grown, and it cannot know that the review is called "Landing gear review,
// variant 3". See EDITING_STRIP_DROP_ORDER for what goes, and in what order.
