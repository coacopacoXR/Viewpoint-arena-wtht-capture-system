// The map's LINE panel — batch BV, generalised by batch BX.
//
// A review whose variant has never met used to have nothing to click: the map said "No
// sessions recorded in this design review yet.", so the variant was invisible everywhere
// outside its own room and read as a variant that had not been saved. The map now draws
// every line whether or not it has met, and a line — its start, the hollow letter a
// session-less variant ends at, or the line a variant is drawn with — opens a panel.
// What is pinned here is that panel: what it says, the way into the room it names, and
// the two lines that are finished with and therefore have no way in at all.
//
// The way in is a BUTTON and not a link, and that is the batch: pages/RoomPage's entry
// guard admits an arrival by its router state or by a mark a deliberate entry writes,
// and a <Link> to the correct address carries neither — so the panel that named the
// right room still bounced the reader back to the lobby.
//
// The words are pinned too, as they are in sessionMap.test.tsx: this is a "Design review"
// with a "Main line" and a "Variant A", and branch, fork and commit do not appear.
// "Merge" does, from batch BX, because it is the user's own word for taking one line
// into another and the panel has to say which line that was.
