// What the room says about Edit to the people who do not have it.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. Three messages, one stack, and
// only one of them is true at a time for any given person — which is what these
// tests pin, because the failure mode of getting it wrong is a room that argues
// with itself.
//
//   • the banner names whoever has Edit on, and never greets the person who has
//     it: that person gets the amber strip, so a banner about themselves would be
//     a second, contradictory answer to "am I editing?".
//   • the prompt is the room's refusal of a press of Edit, and the ONLY place a
//     take-over is offered — taking Edit away from somebody is a decision, so it
//     is never one click from the banner. A refusal of 'role' offers nothing,
//     because there is nobody to take it over from.
//   • while a refusal is up the banner is suppressed: both would be about the
//     same fact, and one of them would be offering a button the other forbids.
//   • each message dismisses itself and no other, and the notice outlives the
//     lock it was about — the person who was displaced sees it after Edit has
//     already moved to somebody else.
//
// All three read state the room server wrote into the store. None of them
// guesses, which is what keeps "only one person edits at a time" from being six
// clients' opinions about it.
