// The merge chooser — the "Merge into…" half of components/review/VariantActions.tsx.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BX. Until this batch a variant could only
// ever be taken into the review's MAIN line, so the action was one button that wrote at
// once and the only thing it could ask was the endpoint's model question. A merge now has
// a DESTINATION and the destination is a choice, so the button opens a chooser — and the
// choice is what is pinned here:
//
//   * WHICH lines are in it. Every line still being explored, minus this variant and minus
//     its own variants: merging a line into one of its own descendants would make the
//     descendant its own ancestor, and every card on both would end up on a line whose
//     history runs in a circle. Dropped and merged lines are not in it either, because a
//     row in a chooser is an offer to write somewhere and a closed line is nowhere.
//   * WHICH one is already selected. The line the variant was started from, and the main
//     line when that one has itself been closed — a chooser that opens with nothing
//     selected makes somebody read a list before they can press the obvious thing.
//   * THE EXACT ARGUMENTS the confirm sends, `keep: null` first. The endpoint reads a
//     missing target as "the main line", so a chooser that sent nothing would merge into
//     a line nobody picked and move every card there.
//   * And the ONE plain question, whose two answers must name the target. A question that
//     said "the main line's" about a merge into Variant A would ask somebody to choose
//     between two models and then write the answer onto a third.
//
// The rest of VariantActions — "Explore a variant from here", "Drop variant", and who is
// offered any of it — is variantActions.test.tsx.
//
// The client, the line cache and the line read are faked; the chooser is the real one.
