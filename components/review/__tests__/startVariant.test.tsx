// The "Variant" button: starting one from somewhere a person looks.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BQ. The action existed already —
// components/review/VariantActions.tsx, on a meeting's stop inside the Sessions map —
// and the user's report was still "i dont see anything about creating the product
// variants". So what is pinned here is what the new button adds rather than the write
// it makes, which is VariantActions' own coverage:
//
//   * it says what the variant will START FROM before it starts one, which the deep
//     version could not: a person who cannot see the consequence of the button does
//     not press it
//   * and it works for a review that has NEVER MET, which the endpoint had to learn:
//     there is no session to leave from, so the line is written with no parent and the
//     new room opens on the model as it is now
//
// The words are the spec. "Variant" on the button, never branch or fork — the icon may
// be a forking line, the sentence beside it is what a hardware engineer reads.
