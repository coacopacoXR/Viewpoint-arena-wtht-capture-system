--
-- This is what makes the tracker able to say "raised on Rev A · still open on
-- Rev C" instead of showing a flat list with no idea which version of the
-- product a risk was about. `raised_on_revision` is a model_revisions.id and is
-- nullable: a card from an ad-hoc session, from a review with no stored
-- revisions, or from before this column existed has nothing to point at, and
-- the tracker renders those without a revision line rather than dropping them.
--
-- `part_node_id` / `part_name` record the mesh a card was pointed at when it was
-- raised, which `component_reference` almost but not quite does: that one is
-- whatever the AI put in a free-text field, and it is only constrained to the
-- model tree's ids when the extraction was given one. These two are what the

-- (batch BG). 'ai' is the default so every existing row reads as an agent's,

-- RLS for the two tables above.
--
-- READ is open to anon and authenticated for any review, and has to be: a
-- participant's screen renders the model tree and the People tab from these two
-- tables, and on a deployment whose identity.mode is 'none' that screen holds
-- only the anon key. This is also what the room server reads to work out a
-- signed-in person's role — it has the anon key and nothing else.
--
-- WRITE is open too, which is the part worth saying plainly:
--
--   ROLE ENFORCEMENT IS IN THE APP AND IN THE ROOM SERVER, NOT HERE.
--   lib/reviews/roles.ts decides who may add a revision, manage people or edit
--   the review, and party/room.server.ts refuses a scene change from somebody
--   whose role does not allow it. The database does not check any of that yet.
--   Locking these tables down per role is a LATER HARDENING STEP, and it cannot
--   be done by copying the policies above: it needs a SECURITY DEFINER helper
--   that answers "what role does auth.uid() hold in this review", which only
--   means anything on a deployment with accounts at all.
--
-- The reason it is open rather than denied is the same reason every other table
-- in this file is open: a `mode: 'none'` install — the default self-hosted one —
-- has no signed-in callers, so an auth.uid()-keyed policy would refuse the only
-- writes that ever happen and the app would not work at all. What guards such an
-- install is the front-door password on the origin, exactly as it does for
-- review_curations and tracker_items.

-- Adding editors and participants goes through the api with the service role
-- (the People tab, batch BH). Open write policies here would let anyone holding
-- the public key make themselves owner or editor of any review.

-- Lines of a design review (added 2026-09-25, docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md
-- batch BK). A design review is the lasting thing; inside it a LINE is a
-- continuous run of meetings, and a session belongs to one.
--
-- Every review has exactly one MAIN line — the meetings everybody means when they
-- say "the review met on Tuesday" — and may have VARIANTS: a named side line
-- started from one of the main line's sessions, to try a different answer without
-- losing the one the main line is holding. `parent_session_id` is that session,
-- and it is what the session map draws the variant leaving from.
--
-- On screen these are "Main line" and "Variant A". The words branch, fork, merge
-- and commit never appear: the people using this are hardware engineers and the
-- plan is explicit that the programming metaphor must not show through.
--
-- `letter` is a variant's A, B, C … and is NULL for the main line, which needs no
-- letter because there is only ever one of it. It is part of
-- `unique (review_id, kind, letter)` so two variants of one review cannot both be
-- Variant A, and it is the suffix of a variant's live room name
-- (`<reviewId>~<letter>`, lib/reviews/lines.partyRoomName) — which is why it is
-- assigned once and never reused, even after the variant is dropped.
--
-- `status` is the variant's fate: 'active' while it is being explored, 'adopted'
-- when its model and cards have been taken into the main line, 'dropped' when it
-- was not. Both are kept for the record rather than deleted — a dropped variant is
-- an answer the review tried and rejected, and that is worth seeing on the map.
-- `closed_at` is when it became one or the other. Batch BK only ever writes
-- 'active'; adopting and dropping are batch BL, and both go through
-- api/reviews/lines.ts rather than through the browser — see the row level
-- security below.
--
-- `adopted_revision_ids` is what the main line's scene became when this variant
-- was adopted into it, as model_revisions ids: the variant's own newest
-- revisions where only the variant had moved, and, where BOTH lines had uploaded
-- a new revision of the same model, the ones the person adopting chose in answer
-- to the one question api/reviews/lines.ts asks. It is a column on the VARIANT
-- and not on the main line, so the main line's own scene is still derived from
-- its last meeting: lib/reviews/linesRepo.originRevisionIds takes the adoption
-- only while it is NEWER than that meeting, and a meeting held after it
-- supersedes it without anything having to be written here again.
--
-- review_id has deliberately NO foreign key, for the same reason
-- tracker_sessions.review_id has none: a line belongs to a review by id, and a
-- key would refuse the write for any room that has no curation row.

-- WHO MAY WRITE A LINE (tightened 2026-09-25, docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md
-- batch BL). Batch BK copied model_revisions here — open read, open insert, open
-- update — because the only write the browser made was `ensureMainLine`, and a
-- main line is a fact about a review rather than a decision anybody could gain
-- from making. Batch BL adds three writes that ARE decisions: starting a variant,
-- adopting one into the main line and dropping one. Each of them moves other
-- people's rows with it (adopting re-homes every card the variant raised, dropping
-- closes them), and each is limited to the review's owners and editors by
-- lib/reviews/roles.ts — a rule that cannot live here, because a `mode: 'none'`
-- install has no signed-in callers and an auth.uid()-keyed policy would refuse
-- every write on the deployment most people run.
--
-- So the browser keeps exactly the write it needs and loses the rest:
--
--   SELECT  open. The map, the tracker's line filter and the room's own chip all
--           read lines, and a line row is a label and a date, not a secret.
--   INSERT  `kind = 'main'` ONLY. That is lib/reviews/linesRepo.ensureMainLine,
--           which has to work from the browser because a room writes it on open,
--           before any meeting has been recorded. Creating a variant is NOT here:
--           it goes through api/reviews/lines.ts, which holds the service role and
--           checks the caller's role the way api/reviews/members.ts does.
--   UPDATE  no policy at all, so every update is refused. Adopting and dropping
--           are the two functions further down this file, called by the api.

-- state and not a failure: a meeting with no transcript and no cards, a room in
-- privacy mode, capture paused while somebody curated the review, and any provider

-- extraction — and a person who only wanted what was said had no way to say so.
-- It is three choices now, and this column is one of them: "Save transcript with
-- this meeting". The other two are the cards (which land in tracker_items as they
-- always did) and a .txt downloaded straight from the browser, which is never
-- stored anywhere.
--
-- AN ARRAY OF ROWS, not the text of the transcript, because the two things a

--   {"t": 7000, "speaker": "Olga Owner", "pointing": "Hinge pin", "untilMs": 12000}
--
-- `t` and `untilMs` are milliseconds into the recording, which is what makes a
-- line findable in a player's scrub bar; the pointing rows are only there when
-- "include what people pointed at" was asked for, and both kinds are sorted by

-- of which wants a megabyte of a meeting it is drawing a dot for. Both readers ask
-- for it for ONE selected session and never in a list query, for the same reason.

-- say "Raised in Variant A · adopted 12 Oct" instead of quietly rewriting where a
-- risk came from.
--

-- ─── Backfill: give every review that has met a main line ────────────────────
--
-- A design review that existed before this batch has sessions and cards and no
-- line, and the moment it is opened the map, the tracker's line filter and the
-- "carried over" group all ask which line those meetings are on. So the answer is
-- written here, once, for every review that has met: its sessions and their cards
-- join a main line, numbered in the order they happened.
--
-- EVERY STATEMENT BELOW IS SAFE TO RUN TWICE, because install.sh re-applies this
-- whole file on every run and an upgrade is exactly a re-run. Each one is keyed on
-- "is still missing" (NOT EXISTS, `is null`) rather than on "has this run before",
-- and the insert conflicts with review_lines_one_main_per_review and does nothing
-- — so a second run adds no line, renumbers no session, and never overwrites a
-- line or an origin that batch BL has since moved.

-- ─── Adopting and dropping a variant ─────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Added 2026-09-25, docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BL. Two
-- functions, and the reason they are functions rather than two requests from
-- api/reviews/lines.ts is that each one writes several tables that have to agree
-- with each other:
--
--   adopt_review_line   moves every card the variant raised onto the main line,
--                       stamps each one with the moment it was adopted, records
--                       what the main line's scene became, and marks the variant
--                       adopted — all of it or none of it.
--   drop_review_line    marks the variant dropped, closes every card still open on
--                       it with the reason, and writes the same status history the
--                       tracker writes when somebody closes a card by hand, so
--                       lib/trackerContinuity can still say WHEN it closed.
--
-- Half of either is worse than neither. A variant whose cards have moved but whose
-- status is still 'active' can be adopted a second time and move them again; a
-- dropped variant with open cards leaves risks sitting on a line nobody will ever
-- meet on, which is the one thing "kept for the record" is not supposed to mean.
--
-- BOTH ARE `security definer` AND EXECUTABLE BY THE SERVICE ROLE ALONE (the
-- revokes are immediately below). The published anon key can still read every row
-- of review_lines and cannot adopt or drop one, and cannot update a line at all —
-- which is what makes the role check in api/reviews/lines.ts the only thing that
-- decides who may do it, rather than one of two things that might.
--
-- `create or replace` and revokes/grants that are safe to repeat: install.sh
-- re-applies this whole file on every run, so an upgrade is exactly a second run
-- of it.

-- ─── Deleting a design review, and deleting one of its sessions ─────────────
--
-- Added 2026-09-25, docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BN. Two
-- functions for the same reason adopt and drop are functions: each one writes
-- several tables that have to agree with each other, and one call is one
-- transaction, which is what makes a half-delete impossible rather than merely
-- unlikely.
--
--   delete_review           everything the review is: the status history of its
--                           cards, its cards, its lines, its meetings, its
--                           roster, its stored revisions, and its own row.
--   delete_review_session   one meeting: its cards and their status history, and
--                           the meeting's own row.
--
-- THE ORDER OF THE DELETES IS THE POINT. review_lines.parent_session_id is a
-- foreign key to tracker_sessions(id), so a review's lines have to go before its
-- meetings or the delete is refused by the key and nothing is removed at all.
-- tracker_items and tracker_status_history both cascade, and are deleted
-- explicitly anyway: a delete that only works because of a cascade two tables
-- away is one that silently stops working when that cascade is edited.
--
-- STORED MODEL FILES ARE NOT DELETED, and cannot be from here. A file in model
-- storage is content-addressed — model_revisions.hash is its name — so the same
-- bytes can be the Rev B of two different reviews, and removing them for one
-- would break the other. The rows go; the files stay, exactly as they do for a
-- revision the admin console deletes.
--
-- SESSION NUMBERS ARE NOT REUSED AND NOT RENUMBERED. tracker_sessions.seq is left
-- alone, so a review that deletes S2 keeps an S1 and an S3: a card that says it
-- was raised in S3 must go on saying that, and renumbering would silently change
-- what every card raised after the deleted meeting claims about itself.
--
-- BOTH ARE `security definer` AND EXECUTABLE BY THE SERVICE ROLE ALONE (the
-- revokes are immediately below), the same pattern as adopt_review_line: EXECUTE
-- goes to PUBLIC by default on a new function and the table-level grants further
-- down this file do not cover functions, so without the revoke the published anon
-- key could delete any review on the install.

-- Application settings (added 2026-09-24, docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md
-- batch BF). One row per setting, written from the admin console's AI section
-- and read back by the server-side AI router (lib/ai/settingsStore.ts).
--
-- `value` holds the non-secret half of a setting (which provider, which model,
-- an endpoint URL); `secret` holds the encrypted half (an API key, a webhook
-- header value) as the `v1:<iv>:<tag>:<ct>` string lib/ai/secretBox.ts writes.
-- The column is text rather than bytea so PostgREST can carry it as JSON and so
-- a dump of this table is still not a dump of the keys: the ciphertext is only
-- readable with a key derived from JWT_SECRET, which lives in the api
-- container's environment and not here.
--
-- THIS TABLE IS THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THE REST OF THIS FILE. Every other table
-- here is wide open on purpose — the app has no per-person identity to key a
-- policy on, and the front-door password guards the origin instead. This one
-- holds credentials, so RLS is enabled with NO POLICIES AT ALL, which in
-- Postgres means deny: the anon and authenticated roles — the two a browser's
-- Supabase key can select — get nothing, not even a row count. Only a request
-- carrying a service-role JWT reaches it, because that role has BYPASSRLS, and
-- only the api container can mint one (api/_lib/serviceRole.ts signs it with
-- JWT_SECRET, which never reaches a browser).
--
-- So the browser cannot read these settings, cannot write them, and cannot
-- discover that they exist. The admin console reaches them only through
-- /api/admin/ai, which is behind requireAdmin and which returns
-- { set: true, last4 } for a secret instead of the secret.

-- Security. Without this, the two browser roles would have select on the
-- credentials table and RLS-with-no-policies would be the only thing stopping
-- them — one mechanism instead of two, and the weaker one to bet a set of API
-- keys on. The supabase/postgres image also installs a DEFAULT PRIVILEGES rule
-- that grants new tables to anon and authenticated as they are created, which
-- is why revoking here is not enough on its own for a table added later: any
-- new table holding a secret needs its own revoke in this same position.
