// The app had never had to cope with "there is no model": store.ts held a
// DEFAULT_BUILT_IN of 'headphones', so `activeModelType` always named a product and
// every reader could assume there was a part list behind it. What these tests pin
// is the new default and the three things that must not silently keep assuming the
// old one — the part list a capture is grounded on, the product name a tracker row
// carries, and a scene that already has a model in it, which must be left alone.
