// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BU. Two halves of one decision live in
// two different browsers: the person who stops the recording presses "Save transcript
// with this meeting", and the person who ends the meeting writes tracker_sessions —
// one meeting is recorded once (__tests__/oneRecordPerMeeting.test.ts). So store.ts's
// endMeeting reads the choice from lib/transcriptKeep, which the room server relayed,
// and builds the transcript out of ITS OWN chatHistory and pointing timeline. That is
// safe because both are the room's already: live lines arrive on every client through
// TRANSCRIPT_LINE and pointing segments through POINTING_SEGMENT.
//
// What is pinned here is the four ways the answer changes — chosen, not chosen,
// privacy mode, capture paused — and that a browser which did NOT end the meeting
// stores nothing however the room voted.
