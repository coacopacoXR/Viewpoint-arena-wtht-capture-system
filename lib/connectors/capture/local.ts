// LocalCaptureProvider — browser-safe RecordingCaptureProvider for the
// self-hosted capture-service (T4.4).
//
// Holds no credential and cannot be given one: there is no token option, and
// nothing in this file reads process.env or import.meta.env. The recording goes
// to our own same-origin endpoint (/api/capture/local), and it is THAT layer
// which attaches the shared secret capture-service requires:
//
//   self-hosted   deploy/nginx/app.conf proxies /api/capture/local to
//                 capture-service:8080/capture and sets the header from the
//                 container's own environment, substituted at start-up rather
//                 than baked into the image;
//   Vercel        api/capture/local.ts forwards the multipart body and adds the
//                 same header from server-side process.env.
//
// The browser therefore never learns the secret and never needs a route to the
// service — which matters because capture-service publishes no port at all (see
// the block comment at the top of docker-compose.yml). This is the rule
// extractClient.ts already follows for the cloud providers, from
// docs/plan/02-connector-adapters.md §2: "never call these directly from the
// browser with a key".
