 * CaptureProvider — a capture backend, of any of three flavours.
 *
 * There are three genuinely different kinds of capture provider and they do not
 * share a single method:
 *
 *  1. SIMULATION-driven (`generateDialogue` + `generateInsightDetails`) —
 *     invents a review conversation from the scene tree. This is what
 *     MockProvider does, extracted verbatim from DialogueEngine.tsx. It is
 *     synchronous because nothing leaves the process.
 *  2. TRANSCRIPT-driven (`extractInsights`) — turns a real, already-spoken
 *     meeting transcript into insight cards. This is what the text-in backends
 *     (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) do. It is async because it crosses a network.
 *  3. RECORDING-driven (`captureRecording`) — takes the meeting's AUDIO and
 *     returns insight cards, transcribing internally. This is what
 *     capture-service does, and it is a flavour of its own rather than a
 *     TranscriptCaptureProvider for one concrete reason: the caller has no
 *     transcript to hand over. A provider that accepted `TranscriptChunk[]`
 *     would be promising something capture-service cannot be given, and a
 *     provider that accepted a Blob cannot be handed chunks.
 *
 * No flavour can implement another honestly: a transcript provider has no
 * phrase library to invent dialogue from, the simulation has no transcript to
 * read, and the recording provider has neither until it has transcribed.
 * Making every capability OPTIONAL — and naming each one precisely with
 * SimulationCaptureProvider / TranscriptCaptureProvider /
 * RecordingCaptureProvider below — is what lets one interface cover all three
 * without any side growing a method it would have to stub or throw from.
 *
 * Call sites must feature-detect before use:
 * `typeof provider.extractInsights === 'function'`. An object with none of
 * these capabilities satisfies this type but fails the contract suite, which is
 * where that mistake gets caught.
