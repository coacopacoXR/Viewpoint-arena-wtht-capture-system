//
// SERVER-ONLY. It constructs CloudflareTurnAdapter (which reads process.env)
// and sends credentials upstream, so it must never be imported by
// browser-reachable code. Client code reads lib/config/publicConfig.ts.
//
// Three guarantees this module exists to provide, in the order they matter:
//
//  1. NOTHING LEAKS. Every `detail` passes through safeDetail() on the way out,
//     and every `provider` through safeProvider(). An adapter that returns an
//     env var name, a URL or an upstream error body has it dropped — the status
//     survives, the wording does not. This is the boundary, not a convention.
//  2. ONE BAD CONNECTOR CANNOT FAIL THE ENDPOINT. Each check is isolated: a
//     throw becomes `degraded`, a hang becomes `degraded` after a deadline, and
//     the rest still report. The report always contains every enabled
//     connector.
//  3. DISABLED MEANS OMITTED. A connector the deployment did not enable — an
//     empty notifications list, or `plm: none` — is absent from the report, not
//     present and failing. An org that deliberately runs with no PLM has a
//     healthy deployment.
