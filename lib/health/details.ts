// The fixed `detail` vocabulary for connector health checks.
//
// Not enforced at runtime — lib/health/sanitize.ts is the enforcement point,
// and it accepts anything matching its shape rule — but every adapter in this
// repo takes its wording from here, so one situation is described one way
// across all of them and an operator can grep a dashboard for a single phrase.
//
// Every value MUST survive sanitize.ts's shape rule: lowercase words of
// letters and digits, joined by single spaces or hyphens, no '.', ':' or '/'.
// lib/health/__tests__/details.test.ts asserts that, so a phrase added here
// that would be silently dropped from the response fails the build instead of
// quietly never appearing.
