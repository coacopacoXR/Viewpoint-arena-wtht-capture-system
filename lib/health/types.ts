// Shared vocabulary for connector health — see docs/plan/05-observability-and-metrics.md §1.

// This module is types only. Every adapter interface imports HealthCheckResult
// from here, and none of them may pull a runtime dependency into a browser
// bundle through it.

/**
 * What an adapter's `healthCheck()` resolves to.
 *
 * `detail` is OPTIONAL and CONSTRAINED. It is published on an unauthenticated
 * endpoint, so lib/health/sanitize.ts drops any detail that is not a short
 * lowercase phrase: an adapter that puts an env var name, a URL, a hostname or
 * an upstream error body in `detail` does not leak it — the detail simply does
 * not appear. Take the wording from lib/health/details.ts's HEALTH_DETAILS and
 * it survives; write anything else and it is discarded.
 *
 * `healthCheck()` must never reject and must never throw. Report failure as
 * `{ ok: false }`. The aggregator guards anyway, because a third-party adapter
 * will not have read this comment.

 * unreachable notification sink must not read like a dead deployment. The
 * endpoint itself stays up and returns the whole report either way.
