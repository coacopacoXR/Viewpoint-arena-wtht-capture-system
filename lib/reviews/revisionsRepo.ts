// The revisions a design review has stored, and the scene they mean.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BC. Batch BB made the room's scene
// a list of models with a line and a revision, and that list lives in the room
// server's memory and its own storage. This is the review's copy of the same
// history, in Postgres, and it is what makes the history outlive the room: a
// room server that hibernates, a meeting that ended last month, a tracker item
// that says "raised on Rev A" — all of them need to know which FILE was Rev A,
// and the room's storage is not where you would look for that.
//
// Two directions:
//
//   * `recordModelRevision` — a new model joined the scene, so the review now
//     has one more version of one more line. Written from the model tree at the
//     moment of import, next to the scene update that put it on screen.
//   * `sceneFromRevisions` — opening a review rebuilds its scene from what it has
//     shown, newest revision of each line visible. This is the path that makes a
//     review "always the same, but if there is some revision … it shouldn't be a
//     totally different room" (the user's note that started plan 14).
//
// Every read answers with an empty list rather than throwing. A review whose
// database predates the table, or whose write failed, still has to open — from
// `asset.modelHash`, which is what the caller falls back to and which is why
// `listModelRevisions` returning [] is not an error condition.
