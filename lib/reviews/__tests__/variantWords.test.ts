// The words batch BL puts on screen about a line that is finished with, and about a
// card that went through one — lib/reviews/lines.ts.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BL. These are pinned as sentences
// rather than as behaviour because they ARE the behaviour: a dropped variant that is
// kept "for the record" is only a record if everything that mentions it says it was
// dropped, and a card closed by a drop has to carry the reason the meeting gave
// rather than a status that says somebody decided something about the engineering.
//
// Also pinned: the letter a new variant gets. It is never a letter a DROPPED variant
// already used, because two sets of cards both saying they came from Variant A is
// exactly what keeping the dropped one was supposed to prevent.
