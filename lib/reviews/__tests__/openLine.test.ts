//
// Opening a line of a design review — lib/reviews/openLine.ts.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BX, and the first thing the user
// reported: "it is not possible to open variants from the lobby". The address every
// "open a line" built was already correct; what was missing was the two things
// pages/RoomPage.tsx's entry guard admits an arrival by — router state carrying
// `fromLobby`, and `sessionStorage.vp_enteredRoom` naming the review — so the room
// sent the person straight back to the lobby and the button looked broken.
//
// What is pinned here is therefore the guard, not the address: a helper that
// navigates to the right place and is still bounced is the bug this file exists to
// keep fixed. The third case matters as much as the first two, because it is the one
// that would otherwise be found in production by somebody who has never typed a name:
// a browser with no stored identity must be sent to the lobby to be asked for one,
// and the lobby must be told WHICH LINE to enter afterwards.
