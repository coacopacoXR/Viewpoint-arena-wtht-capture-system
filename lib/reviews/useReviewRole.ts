// What I may do in the design review I am standing in.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH. lib/reviews/roles.ts is the
// rule and party/reviewRoles.ts is the room server's copy of the same join; this
// is the browser's. It gathers the six facts resolveRole asks for and hands back
// a role plus a `can(action)` the UI hides buttons with.
//
// Hiding a button is NOT the enforcement — the room server refuses a scene
// change by role, and api/reviews/members.ts refuses a membership write the same
// way. This hook exists so the room does not offer somebody a tool that would
// then be refused, and so the one table in roles.ts is the only place the answer
// is written down.
//
// On a deployment whose identity.mode is 'none' — the default self-hosted
// install — nothing here touches Supabase at all. Not "calls it and ignores the
// answer": the effect returns before the first request, exactly as useAuth does,
// and the role comes out the way it did before roles existed. The meeting host
// gets the editor's powers (which is what the old curate page allowed anybody to
// do, since anybody could open it) and everybody else is a participant.
