// The gate that pauses capture while a design review is being edited.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BH: "While Edit is on for anyone in
// the room, capture (live transcript and card extraction) is paused for the room,
// and resumes on Done."
//
// What is pinned here is the CONTRACT the two capture paths rely on, because they
// have nothing else in common: one asks from inside a React render (the per-speaker
// slicer, through lib/RecordingContext) and one asks from an async queue processor
// that has no render cycle at all (the extractor). A module with one writer and no
// opinion of its own is what lets both get the same answer.
//
// The pause being ROOM-wide rather than mine is the part that is easy to get
// wrong, and it is asserted here by name: the reason sentence names whoever has
// Edit on, who is usually not the person reading it.
