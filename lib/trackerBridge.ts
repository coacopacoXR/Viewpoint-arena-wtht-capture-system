// Meeting → tracker.
//
// One call, at meeting-end, turning what happened in a room into a session row
// and one item row per card. Everything the tracker knows about a meeting is
// written here, which is why the design review's continuity is written here too:
// a card that does not say which revision of which product it was raised on is a
// card the tracker can only list, and the plan's whole ask was that it be able to
// say "raised on Rev A · still open on Rev C" instead
// (docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BC).
//
// Nothing here may break a meeting. Every failure is logged and answered with
// null: a meeting that ends without reaching the tracker is a lost record, which
// is bad; a meeting that cannot end is worse.
//
// WHAT THIS WRITES IS ONLY WHAT THIS MEETING PRODUCED. The cards a meeting started
// with — the ones its line was still carrying from the sessions before it, which
// the room shows in the Capture panel's "Carried over" group — are tracker items
// that already exist, and they are never in `insightCards`, so they are never
// inserted again. A risk raised in S2 and still open in S4 is one row with one
// history, not three copies of itself.
