// RecordingContext — one recorder, two views, per-speaker live transcript.
//
// Batch W of the grounded-capture plan (section B: every participant records
// their own microphone). The recording controls lived inside PostMeetingSummary
// (ManagerPanel), which replaced the room sidebar — the person recording could
// not watch the LIVE TRANSCRIPT panel. The controls now live in the transcript
// tab AND in the Manager Workspace, both reading from a single RecordingProvider
// mounted in RoomPage.
//
// What this provider owns:
//   * the single useMeetingRecorder instance (host only, mixed stream, for
//     extraction — the final POST /capture);
//   * the useOwnMicTranscriber hook (every client, own mic, for the live
//     transcript);
//   * the useLiveTranscript hook that feeds the LIVE TRANSCRIPT panel;
//   * the LocalCaptureProvider used for both live chunks and the final
//     captureRecording() call;
//   * the elapsed timer, the summarise/retry flow, and the outcome state;
//   * the RECORDING_STATE broadcast (host presses Record → every client
//     starts its own mic slicer).
//
// What it exposes: { state, elapsedMs, outcome, summarising, start, stop,
// retry, liveLines, canRecord, recordingState, ownMicStatus, stopSharingMic }.
// Consumers are pure presentation.
