// A highlight that gives the material back what it took — batch BT.
//
// Two paths light a mesh up: a selection in the tree or a click in the 3D view, and
// somebody's laser pointing at it. Both used to write the highlight and then write
// BLACK when the highlight ended, which is right for a material this app authored
// (components/Scene/Product.tsx declares its emissive in JSX, where black IS the
// original) and wrong for a material a file brought with it. A CAD assembly with an
// emissive warning stripe, a glTF whose author gave a lens its own glow, came back
// from one selection permanently dead: the second half of the user's report that
// "it is not great at keeping the textures".
//
// So the original is remembered in `material.userData` the first time a highlight
// touches it, and a highlight that ends restores THAT rather than a constant. It is
// stamped lazily rather than at load: a STEP file can carry tens of thousands of
// materials and at most a handful are ever selected.
