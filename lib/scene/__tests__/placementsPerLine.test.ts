// Positions, per line — batch BV.
//
// `asset.placements` used to be the review's ONE slot, shared by every line, so a variant
// that moved a model overwrote where the main line had left it and whichever room
// re-seeded from the database last won. These tests pin the three promises the fix makes:
//
//   1. a variant's positions go to its own slot and leave the main line's alone;
//   2. the main line's positions go where every review has always kept them, and leave
//      every variant's slot alone;
//   3. a variant with no slot of its own opens on the main line's positions, because
//      "starts where the main line is" is what starting a variant means.
//
// The adopting half — a variant's positions becoming the main line's — is in
// deploy/__tests__/adoptLinePlacements.test.ts, because it is a line of SQL in
// `adopt_review_line` and not a line of anything here.
