// Starting a room whose server has never held a scene — the client half of batch BQ2.
//
// The room server sends its scene on connect even when it is empty, and the client
// replaces its own copy with what arrives (batch BB's rule: the room is the live space).
// That was correct for a room that HAD a scene and wrong for one that never had one —
// every new variant room, and any main room whose server storage is gone — where it wiped
// the models the client had just built from the review's history and nothing put them back.
// Found live: a review with two imported models, then Variant, and the variant's room said
// "No model yet", and went on saying it after a full reload.
//
// `seeded: false` is the server asking. These tests are about who answers, with what:
//   * a client that may change the models computes the scene from the review's stored
//     revisions FOR THE LINE IT IS ON and sends it as SCENE_SEED;
//   * a client that may not change them does not — it waits for the seeded SCENE_STATE,
//     the same one a late joiner gets, so a participant can see the models and cannot
//     choose them;
//   * a room that HAS been seeded is left alone, whatever the database says, because a
//     room somebody emptied on purpose must not be refilled behind their back.
//
// Same harness as joinKnock.test.tsx and guestPresence.test.tsx: a fake partysocket driven
// by hand. The two database reads showReviewScene makes are faked; the scene arithmetic
// (sceneFromRevisions, revisionsForSession, applyStoredPlacements) is the real one, so what
// is asserted here is the scene a history actually produces.
