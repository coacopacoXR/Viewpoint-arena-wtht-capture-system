// The `local` model store: one directory, one file per hash.
//
// This is the default provider and the one the Docker install runs — a named
// volume (`models-data`) mounted at /data/models on the `api` service, so an
// upgrade that recreates the container does not take every room's model with it.
//
// Layout, flat:
//
//     <dir>/<sha256>          the bytes, and nothing but the bytes
//     <dir>/<sha256>.json     the sidecar (lib/storage/sidecar.ts)
//
// Flat is enough because the name is a 64-char content address: there are no
// collisions to shard around and no directory to grow a listing of. It also
// means the ONLY thing that decides a path is a value MODEL_HASH_RE accepted,
// which is what makes a request for `/api/models/../../etc/passwd` unreach this
// module at all — and it is checked again here so a future caller that forgot
// the api's validation still cannot escape `dir`.

  /**
   * Write to a temp file in the SAME directory and rename over the destination.
   *
   * Two reasons, and both are about a reader that arrives mid-write:
   *
   *   1. `rename` within one filesystem is atomic, so a concurrent `get` sees
   *      either no object or a complete one — never the first 40 MB of a
   *      200 MB STEP file, which a three.js loader would report as a corrupt
   *      model rather than as a half-written one.
   *   2. The destination path only ever exists complete, so a crash cannot
   *      leave a truncated object that every later `put` of the same hash
   *      skips as "already stored".
   *
   * The temp name carries the pid and random bytes because two api requests for
   * the same file can be in flight at once, and one rename winning over a
   * partial temp from the other would resurrect it.
