// Server-only model file storage.

// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md §"File storage". A model file is
// CONTENT-ADDRESSED: its SHA-256 hex digest is that file's identity everywhere
// — in the URL that serves it (/api/models/<hash>), in the MODEL_CHANGE message
// a room now sends instead of the bytes, and in a curated review's asset. Two
// consequences the rest of this module leans on:
//
//   * a download is cacheable for ever, because a name cannot outlive the
//     content it names;
//   * `put` is idempotent, so uploading a file the store already holds costs
//     nothing and stores no second copy — which is also what makes the same
//     revision uploaded from three browsers converge on one object.
//
// Nothing here imports three.js, a worker, React or the config loader: it is
// pulled in by api/models.ts and api/models/[hash].ts, and by nothing the
// browser bundles. The client side talks to /api/models only.
