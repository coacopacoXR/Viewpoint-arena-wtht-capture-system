// party/verifyJwt.ts — the room server's half of "a signed-in name cannot be
// spoofed".
//
// docs/plan/13-identity.md, batch AZ. The browser's Supabase client already
// carries the signed-in person's access token, and GoTrue signs it with the
// same JWT_SECRET that PostgREST (PGRST_JWT_SECRET) and Realtime
// (API_JWT_SECRET) verify. Checking that signature here is what turns the name
// in a PRESENCE payload from "whatever the client typed" into "what the account
// says", with no second trust boundary and no call to the auth service.
//
// Deliberately pure and dependency-light: no PartyKit imports, no room state,
// nothing to inject. Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle`) is the only host API and both
// runtimes that execute this file have it — Cloudflare's workerd, which is
// where `partykit dev` runs room code, and node, which is where the tests run.
//
// It answers a question and nothing else. What the room server DOES with the
// answer — overwriting the name, forcing `guest`, and above all removing the
// token from the payload before it is stored or relayed — lives in
// room.server.ts, because that is where the payload is.
