// GET  /api/health — per-connector health for the whole deployment
// HEAD /api/health — status only, for a load balancer or a container probe
//
// One URL for an IT dashboard and for install.sh's "prove the config actually
// resolves" step (docs/plan/06-deployment-and-installation.md §2 step 8,
// docs/plan/05-observability-and-metrics.md §1).
//
// UNAUTHENTICATED by design — a dashboard that had to log in first would not be
// polled, and an installer cannot authenticate against a stack it is still
// bringing up. That is why the response carries per-connector STATUS ONLY:
//
//   * no credential, and no env var NAME — a name tells an attacker which
//     variable to look for and is deployment internals besides;
//   * no upstream error body — an LLM or PLM error can quote the request, and
//     for capture that request contains a meeting transcript;
//   * no internal hostname or URL — capture.serviceUrl is a container name on a
//     network that deliberately has no published port.
//
// lib/health/sanitize.ts enforces all three at the single exit point, so an
// adapter that gets it wrong loses its `detail` rather than leaking it.
//
// A failing connector makes the report `ok: false` and the status 503. It does
// NOT make the endpoint fail: the body always carries every enabled connector,
// because "which one is down" is the entire value of the response.
