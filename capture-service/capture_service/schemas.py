"""Wire shapes shared with the TypeScript app.

These models are the Python half of a contract that already exists in
TypeScript, and they are deliberately not free to drift:

  * `TranscriptChunk`  ↔ lib/connectors/capture/types.ts `TranscriptChunk`
  * `SlideContext`     ↔ lib/connectors/capture/types.ts `SlideContext`
  * `InsightCard`      ↔ types.ts `InsightCard`
  * `InsightDetails`   ↔ types.ts `InsightDetails`

Field names go over the wire in camelCase, exactly as the TypeScript types
spell them, because the browser client re-validates this service's responses
with the same strict parser it uses for the cloud path
(`validateExtractionPayload` in lib/connectors/capture/parseInsightCards.ts).
That parser rejects UNKNOWN KEYS, so a snake_case field or an extra
transport-metadata key on the response envelope is not a cosmetic difference —
it is a rejected response. tests/test_typescript_parity.py pins the key sets
against the TypeScript source.

Enums mirror the TypeScript string-literal unions value-for-value; parse_cards
derives its allowlists from them so a value cannot be legal in one place and
illegal in another.

The two JSON request bodies (`ExtractRequest`, `SummaryRequest`) are the
text-only half of the same contract: the server-side AI router
(docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md) picks a provider per job, so the
transcription and the extraction may come from different places and the
service needs routes that take a transcript instead of a recording. They are
the only request MODELS here — /capture and /transcribe are multipart forms,
whose fields FastAPI validates individually.
