"""Failure taxonomy for capture-service.

Two rules shape every class in this module, and they are the reason it exists
as a single module rather than ad-hoc `HTTPException`s in the routes.

1. `code` is machine-readable and is the ONLY part of a failure that reaches an
   HTTP response body (plus the small, non-sensitive extras a subclass opts in
   to via `response_extras()`). The vocabulary matches the TypeScript capture
   API — api/capture/extract.ts and lib/connectors/capture/extractClient.ts —
   so the browser client (T4.4) can translate a failure from either service
   with one switch statement.

2. `message` is transcript-free BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing here may quote the
   model's output, the transcript, the uploaded filename or a credential,
   because messages get logged and a logged traceback is a leak. This is a
   deliberate divergence from lib/connectors/capture/parseInsightCards.ts,
   whose messages quote a 120-char snippet of model output and are kept safe
   only because api/capture/extract.ts forwards `reason` and never `message`.
   Here the message itself is safe, so there is no code path that has to
   remember not to log it. Where an upstream detail genuinely helps an
   operator (Ollama's own short `error` string, a whisper load failure) it is
   bounded, whitespace-flattened and stays in the server log.

Status codes mirror the TypeScript endpoint where the same situation exists:
413 for anything over a size limit, 422 for a well-formed request whose model
output could not be used, 502/503/504 for upstream problems, 500 for our own.
