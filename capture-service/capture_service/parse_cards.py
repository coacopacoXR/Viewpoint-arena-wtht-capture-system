"""Defensive parser for model-produced InsightCard payloads.

A line-by-line port of lib/connectors/capture/parseInsightCards.ts, which is
the authority on this contract: the same allowlists, the same failure reasons,
the same order of checks, so a reply that the TypeScript parser accepts this
one accepts, and a reply it rejects is rejected here for the same reason. Both
implementations are pinned to the TypeScript source by
tests/test_typescript_parity.py.

The rule this module exists to enforce is unchanged: a model may return
ANYTHING, and the service must never crash and never accept a half-built card.
Parsing a batch is all-or-nothing — if cards[7] is malformed, none of the eight
is returned.

Two deliberate divergences from the TypeScript original, both because this
message text is written to the service log:

  1. No message quotes model output. The TypeScript parser embeds a 120-char
     snippet of the reply, which quotes the transcript; that is safe there only
     because api/capture/extract.ts forwards `reason` and never `message`.
     Here the message itself carries no content, so no call site has to
     remember the rule.
  2. Unknown JSON key names are echoed only when they are identifier-shaped
     (`_safe_key_names`). A realistic failure is the model inventing
     "confidence"; a key holding prose would be transcript text, and this
     module does not launder either into a log line.

Python/JSON differences from JSON.parse that are handled explicitly:
`json.loads` accepts the bare constants NaN, Infinity and -Infinity, which
JSON.parse rejects, so `parse_constant` refuses them and the input is
classified the same way the TypeScript parser would classify it.
