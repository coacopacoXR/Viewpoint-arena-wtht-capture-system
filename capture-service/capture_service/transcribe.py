"""Batch transcription: faster-whisper behind a swappable interface.

docs/local-capture-plan.md's "Strong suggestion for the first iteration" is
explicit that the MVP is BATCH, not streaming: the browser records the whole
meeting, uploads the file, and this module runs Whisper over it once. There is
no chunk buffering, no partial-transcript broadcast and no WebSocket here —
that is T4.7, deliberately sequenced after the offline path is solid.

The `Transcriber` protocol exists for two reasons:

  1. TESTS RUN WITHOUT WHISPER. `FasterWhisperTranscriber` imports
     faster_whisper inside `_load_model`, on first use, so nothing in this
     package pulls in ctranslate2/onnxruntime at import time and the test suite
     needs no model download, no GPU and no network. CI installs
     requirements-dev.txt and NOT requirements-whisper.txt — if any code path
     grew a top-level whisper import, CI would fail with ModuleNotFoundError.
     That is the guarantee, enforced by the environment rather than by a
     comment.
  2. The plan lists alternatives (whisper.cpp, WhisperX, the
     whisper-asr-webservice container). Swapping one in means implementing
     `transcribe()` and passing it to `create_app(transcriber=...)`; no route,
     schema or parser changes.

Speaker labels: faster-whisper does NOT diarize. Batch mode therefore emits one
label for the whole recording (DEFAULT_SPEAKER_ID) rather than inventing speaker
turns — a fabricated speaker id would flow into InsightCard.agentId and be
displayed as "who said this" in the Manager workspace, which is worse than an
honest single label. Real diarization is WhisperX territory and is an open
question in docs/local-capture-plan.md §"Open questions".
