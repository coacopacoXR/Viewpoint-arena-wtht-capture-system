// Switching the line a room is on, from inside the room, without a reload —
// pages/RoomPage.tsx.
//
// docs/plan/15-sessions-and-variants.md batch BX. The user's report was that a variant
// could not be opened at all; the fix for that is lib/reviews/openLine, which gives an
// arrival the two things the room's entry guard admits it by. This file is about the
// OTHER half of the same complaint: once a room can be moved onto another line — from
// the chip's "Go to…", from the Variant menu, from the session map — the move has to be
// a move and not a partial one.
//
// A line is a different PartyKit room, a different scene, a different set of
// carried-over cards, a different Edit lock and a different name on the chip, and until
// this batch every one of those was owned by an effect or a ref whose dependency list
// had no line in it — because a room could not change line without a page load. So what
// is pinned here is the whole set, by watching the room rebuild itself: the socket is
// asked for the new room's name and never for two at once, the store's line and review
// are cleared by the old session's unmount and set again by the new one, and the review
// is seeded afresh rather than carried over.
//
// And the one room that must NOT behave like a meeting: a line that was dropped, whose
// address keeps working because a dropped variant is kept for the record. It says why it
// was dropped and offers the main line, and the room server refuses its scene changes —
// partykit/__tests__/server.reviewLinesFacts.test.ts is where that half is pinned.
//
// The harness is pages/__tests__/roomLineQuery.test.tsx's: the real RoomPage and the
// real stores, with the socket, the canvas and the database stood in for.
