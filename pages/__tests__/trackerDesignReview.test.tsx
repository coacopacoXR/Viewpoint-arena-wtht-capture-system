// The tracker's design-review continuity: what a card says about the revisions it
// has lived through, and the filter that shows one review's whole history.
//
// docs/plan/14-rooms-models-admin-ai.md batch BC. The sentences themselves are
// decided in lib/trackerContinuity.ts and pinned there; what is pinned here is
// that the page actually asks for them — that a card on the board carries its
// line, that a review can be filtered for and opens onto its revisions and its
// meetings, and that the meetings recorded before this batch (which have no
// review_id at all) are still reachable rather than becoming a remainder
// nothing can select.
//
// Supabase, the curations read and the revisions read are all faked, the way
// pages/__tests__/lobbyYourReviews.test.tsx fakes them: the page under test is the
// real one, including the board's dnd-kit columns.
