# The `app` container: build the Vite bundle, serve it with nginx.

# Build context is the REPO ROOT (see docker-compose.yml), so paths here are
# repo-relative. Two stages, because the runtime image must not contain Node,
# npm, the lockfile or node_modules: it serves static files, and a container
# that only serves files should not carry a JavaScript runtime to be attacked.

# VITE_-prefixed values are INLINED INTO THE BUNDLE by Vite at build time, so
# they have to be present in this stage and they cannot be supplied at runtime.
# That is the documented VITE_ rule (scripts/check-public-env.mjs, .env.example):
# only client-safe values may travel this way. The Supabase pair is the approved
# exception — the anon key is public by design, with access control enforced by
# Postgres Row Level Security — and VITE_PARTYKIT_HOST is a hostname, not a
# credential. A secret passed as a build ARG would be readable by anyone who can
# `docker history` the image, which is why nothing else is passed here.

# The config is an envsubst TEMPLATE, not a plain conf.d file, and the
# distinction is a security property: ${CAPTURE_SHARED_SECRET} is substituted at
# CONTAINER START from the environment docker-compose passes in, so the secret
# never enters a layer. A value baked in at build time is readable by anyone who
# can `docker history` the image — the same reason the VITE_ build args above
# carry only client-safe values.
#
# NGINX_ENVSUBST_FILTER restricts substitution to CAPTURE_* names. Without it
# envsubst would also eat nginx's own $uri, $host and $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for,
# which are not environment variables and must survive into the served config.
#
# Declared here as well as passed by compose so the variable is always DEFINED:
# envsubst only substitutes names it was given, and an unlisted ${...} would
# reach nginx verbatim, where it is an unknown-variable start-up failure. Empty
# is a valid value — capture-service treats an empty secret as authentication
# off, and `proxy_set_header X-Capture-Token ""` makes nginx omit the header.
